Migration from on-prem to AWS

Migrating to AWS? Hereâ€™s How ADS, MGN, and DMS Simplify the Process! ðŸš€

Migrating workloads to AWS can feel overwhelming, but with the right tools, it becomes much easier. I recently worked on a migration project and leveraged AWS ADS, MGN, and DMS to streamline the process. Hereâ€™s what I learned:

ðŸ”¹ AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS):
* Automated Workload Discovery â€“ ADS scanned my on-prem environment and provided detailed insights into server dependencies.
* Performance Metrics â€“ It helped analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage, making capacity planning easier.
* Application Mapping â€“ Identifying app-to-app dependencies was key to avoiding migration issues.
* One Feature I Loved about ADS is the ability to generate migration recommendations tailored to the workload's needs, enabling more informed decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Application Migration Service (MGN):
* Seamless Lift-and-Shift â€“ Automatically converts physical, virtual, or cloud-based servers to run natively on AWS.
* Continuous Replication â€“ Ensures up-to-date data and near-zero downtime during migration.
* Test Before Cutover â€“ Allows multiple non-disruptive test migrations before the final switch.

ðŸ”¹ AWS Database Migration Service (DMS):
* Minimal Downtime Migration â€“ Keeps databases operational during migration, reducing impact.
* Supports multiple database engines, including SQL, NoSQL, and cloud-native databases.
* Schema Conversion â€“ Helps modernize legacy databases for AWS-native services.

ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways from My Migration Project:
âœ… Better Planning â€“ ADS eliminated guesswork by mapping dependencies.
âœ… Faster Migration â€“ MGN automated the lift-and-shift process with minimal manual effort.
âœ… Risk Reduction â€“ DMS ensured a seamless database transition with minimal downtime.
AWSâ€™s migration tools made this project efficient and hassle-free. If youâ€™re planning a cloud migration, these services can save time, reduce risks, and optimize costs.

Have you used ADS, MGN, or DMS for migration?
